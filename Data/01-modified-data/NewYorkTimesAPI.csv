"Emerging data show that some of the coronavirus’s most potent damage is inflicted on the heart.","SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was initially thought to primarily impact the lungs — SARS stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome.” Now we know there is barely a part of the body this infection spares.

Since then you have done everything you can to stay healthy: you exercise, track your blood pressure, take a statin."
"Editorial on importance of new studies that find that substance known as C-reactive protein, called CRP, may be as important as cholesterol in diagnosis and treatment of heart disease","The evidence has gotten much stronger that a substance known as C-reactive protein may be every bit as important as cholesterol in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. Back in 2002, a thought-provoking study found that a blood test for C-reactive protein, called CRP, was actually better than the standard cholesterol test at predicting the risk of a heart attack or a stroke. Now two studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine have shown that drugs that reduce the levels of that protein in patients with severe heart disease can slow the progression of atherosclerosis and prevent heart attacks and cardiac-related deaths."

"Microvascular heart disease affects about four times as many women as men, and the condition can be very serious.","Q. I have been diagnosed with microvascular heart disease, which I was told mostly affects women and is not considered “serious” in and of itself. How long can it exist before it turns into serious heart disease?"
"Seniors with long-lived parents are much healthier than their peers, a new study concludes, perhaps because they are protected from cardiovascular risks.","Older adults whose parents lived 100 years or longer are healthier than others their age and have dramatically lower risks of heart attack, stroke, diabetes or dying from any other cause, researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine report in a new study."
"Patients with strep infections were far more likely to suffer damaged heart valves if they had a certain mutation, researchers reported.","Whether a painful strep throat turns into a fatal case of heart disease depends not just on prompt antibiotic treatment but also on the patient’s genetic makeup, according to a new study led by Oxford University scientists."
"Following more than 5,000 people in six cities and air pollution data, researchers found that the greater the level of air pollution, the greater the thickening of the carotid artery, a known risk for heart attack and stroke.","Air pollution has been linked to cardiovascular disease, and now researchers may be closer to understanding why: it increases atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, a known risk for heart attack and stroke."

A study published today has found that mildly elevated levels of cholesterol or slightly above normal blood pressure from ages 18 to 30 are strong predictors of having coronary artery calcium at ages 30 to 35. Coronary artery calcium, a form of arterial plaque, is a predictor of later heart disease."

"Doctors are rethinking diagnosis and treatment of heart disease in women after research shows marked differences in how illness manifests itself in women verses men; some research suggests that smaller anatomy of women is driving force behind more severe and often difficult to treat condition; microvascular disease, type of heart disease which is not evident in angiogram, is much more common in women and may go unrecognized; Dr Bairey Merz, Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation study chairwoman, points out that angiograms alone will not help reduce heart disease in women; variety of warning signs and life style indicators that point to heart disease and particularly microvascular disease in women discussed; graph; photos; drawings (L)","Kim Kachmann-Geltz did everything right. She ran five miles a day, dutifully ate oatmeal and wheat toast, stayed slim, never smoked. Her blood pressure was perfect. Her genes, she thought, were lucky: her great-grandmother had lived to 102."
"Scientific research has determined that higher than normal C-reactive protein levels increase risk of heart disease; research, however, does not show that lowering levels reduces risk nor have scientists discovered treatment that specifically lowers CRP; gaps between identifying risk and treatment leave doctors at loss to help patients with high CRP levels; many insurers will cover cost of CRP test, but not all doctors support administering test; CRP can be lowered by life style changes, such as losing weight or quitting smoking; photo (M)","When Richard Newton read in a magazine last year that high levels of a protein called CRP were as powerful as high cholesterol in predicting heart disease risk, he went to his doctor to be tested."
