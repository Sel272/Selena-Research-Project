Now two studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine have shown that drugs that reduce the levels of that protein in patients with severe heart disease can slow the progression of atherosclerosis and prevent heart attacks and cardiac-related deaths.","The New York Times","2005-01-11T05:00:00+0000","article","Editorial Desk","Opinion","Editorial","nyt://article/cd9ab123-b6d2-5b98-9e55-a2a61713377d",393,"nyt://article/cd9ab123-b6d2-5b98-9e55-a2a61713377d",NA,"A","18","The New Heart Disease Threat","Editorial",NA,"The New Heart Disease Threat",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16607,10,62
