Hi. My name is Xuening(Selena) Yang. I am a recent graduate of George Washington University, where I earned an bachelor degree in Business and Business Analytics with a minor in Statistics. Now, I'm starting an exciting academic journey as a master's degree in data science and analytics at Georgetown University. My passion for data-driven decision making and desire to excel in the business world led me down this path. I have also been fortunate to broaden my horizons through the University of Edinburgh's rich exchange programme, exposing me to different cultures and global perspectives. Outside of the classroom, I am an avid traveler, constantly seeking new adventures and cultural experiences. Traveling not only fueled my curiosity, but also enhanced my resilience and critical thinking skills, which are invaluable assets in the ever-growing field of data science and analytics. With my background and current academic pursuits, I am ready to take on the challenge and make a meaningful contribution to this dynamic and exciting field.
